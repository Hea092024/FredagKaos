      <p>Oh, before they turn off all the lights</p>
      <p>I won't read you your wrongs or your rights</p>
      <p>The time has gone</p>
      <p>I'll tell you goodnight, close the door</p>
      <p>Tell you I love you once more</p>
      <p>The time has gone</p>
      <p>So here it is</p>
      <p>I'm not your son, you're not my father</p>
      <p>We're just two grown men saying goodbye</p>
      <p>No need to forgive, no need to forget</p>
      <p>I know your mistakes and you know mine</p>
      <p>And while you're sleeping I'll try to make you proud</p>
      <p>So, daddy, won't you just close your eyes?</p>
      <p>Don't be afraid, it's my turn</p>
      <p>To chase the monsters away</p>
      <p>Oh, well, I'll read a story to you</p>
      <p>Only difference is this one is true</p>
      <p>The time has gone</p>
      <p>I folded your clothes on the chair</p>
      <p>I hope you sleep well, don't be scared</p>
      <p>The time has gone</p>
      <p>So here it is</p>
      <p>I'm not your son, you're not my father</p>
      <p>We're just two grown men saying goodbye</p>
      <p>No need to forgive, no need to forget</p>
      <p>I know your mistakes and you know mine</p>
      <p>And while you're sleeping I'll try to make you proud</p>
      <p>So, daddy, won't you just close your eyes?</p>
      <p>Don't be afraid, it's my turn</p>
      <p>To chase the monsters away</p>
      <p>Sleep a lifetime</p>
      <p>Yes, and breathe a last word</p>
      <p>You can feel my hand on your own</p>
      <p>I will be the last one</p>
      <p>So I'll leave a light on</p>
      <p>Let there be no darkness, in your heart</p>
      <p>But I'm not your son, you're not my father</p>
      <p>We're just two grown men saying goodbye</p>
      <p>No need to forgive, no need to forget</p>
      <p>I know your mistakes and you know mine</p>
      <p>And while you're sleeping I'll try to make you proud</p>
      <p>So, daddy, won't you just close your eyes?</p>
      <p>Don't be afraid, it's my turn</p>
      <p>To chase the monsters away</p>
